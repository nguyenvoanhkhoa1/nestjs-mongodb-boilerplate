## Prerequisites

We assume that everyone who comes here is **`programmer with intermediate knowledge`** and we also need to understand more before we begin in order to reduce the knowledge gap.

1. Understand [NestJs Fundamental][ref-nestjs], Main Framework. NodeJs Framework with support fully TypeScript.
2. Understand [Typescript Fundamental][ref-typescript], Programming Language. It will help us to write and read the code.
3. Understand [ExpressJs Fundamental][ref-nodejs], NodeJs Base Framework. It will help us in understanding how the NestJs Framework works.
4. Understand what and how database works, especially NoSql and [MongoDB.][ref-mongodb]
5. Understand Repository Design Pattern or Data Access Object Design Pattern. It will help to read, and write the source code
6. Understand The SOLID Principle and KISS Principle for better write the code.
7. Optional. Understand Microservice Architecture, Clean Architecture, and/or Hexagonal Architecture. It can help you to understand more deep about this project.
8. Optional. Understanding [The Twelve Factor Apps][ref-12factor]. It can help to serve the project.
9. Optional. Understanding [Docker][ref-docker].
